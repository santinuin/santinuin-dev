description: A brief introduction to my professional journey and passions.
---

Greetings! I'm Santiago Nu√±ez Ingas, a dynamic professional merging the analytical world of Web Development with the insightful realm of Psychology and the creative expression of Music. This unique trifecta fuels my approach to crafting digital experiences that are not only functional and aesthetically pleasing but also deeply user-centric and engaging.

My journey into tech is driven by a fascination with how humans interact with digital interfaces and a passion for building innovative solutions. I specialize in frontend development, constantly honing my skills in modern web technologies to bring ideas to life. I believe in continuous learning and am always excited to explore new tools and frameworks that can elevate my work.

When I'm not coding, you might find me delving into psychological research, playing some intrument, or exploring the latest in tech and design. I'm on a mission to create meaningful and impactful projects. Let's connect and build something extraordinary!
