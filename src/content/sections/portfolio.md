I have worked on a variety of projects that showcase my skills in web
development, psychology, and music. Here are a few highlights:
1. **Personal Portfolio Website**: A responsive website built with React and Tailwind CSS to
showcase my work and skills.
2. **Mental Health App**: A web application designed to help users manage their mental health through journaling and mood tracking.
3. **Music Collaboration Platform**: A platform for musicians to collaborate on projects, share ideas, and provide feedback.
